lang-make-and-shake
======

The language-maker-breaker-and-shaker
makes, breaks and shakes *human-like* languages.
Its predecessor is cl-sca, which is contained in the scope of the new project.

(This is a placeholder for the eventual program while I finish other projects.)

Plans
======

## Make ##
Creating languages programmatically, starting from the phonemes upward.
* Create a phonology
  * Generate a phonemic inventory
  * Make phonotactical rules
  * Base it on existing languages (Germanic, Japonic)
  * Sliders (lotsa vowels, lotsa consonants)
  * Generic function to create words based on those rules
* Create a grammar
  * Assign meanings to certain words
  * Chain them up via syntax

## Break ##
Break up lannguages into daughter languages
using the awesome power of language change.
* *Sound changes*
* Other changes?

## Shake ##
Be able to categorize languages through built-in families.
* Define, create, and assign languages to language families
* Upgrade languages to language families via language diversification
  (e.g. English â†’ Anglic langauges including American, British)
* Define langauge stats
  * Vibrance
  * Dialects (maybe as a separate thing?)
